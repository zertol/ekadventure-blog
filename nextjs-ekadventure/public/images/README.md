# Image Assets

This directory contains image assets used in the EkAdventure Blog.

## Placeholder Images

During development, we're using the following placeholder images:

- `adventure-header.jpg` - A landscape-oriented image used for header backgrounds (1920x1080px)
- `profile-avatar.jpg` - A circular avatar image (400x400px)

In production, these should be replaced with actual images relevant to the blog content.

## Image Optimization

Next.js automatically optimizes images when using the `<Image>` component from 'next/image'. 
For background images applied via CSS, make sure to use appropriately sized and optimized images.
